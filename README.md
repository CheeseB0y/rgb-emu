# rgb-emu
RGB-Emu is a WIP GameBoy emulator built with the rust programming language. This project is meant to be a learning experience and practice for me. In a world where devs are increasingly relying on AI to speed up their workflow, it's more important now than ever to be a truly competent and capable developer. My goal is to build this without the help of any AI and to become a better developer in the process.
